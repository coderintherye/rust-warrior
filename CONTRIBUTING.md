# Contributing

At this point, I've just started this project. I'm referring to
[Ruby Warrior][ruby-warrior] a LOT, but I'm doing things very
differently in certain cases. There are a ton of features to add
still, and as I am working on them I will probably adjust the design
of the game overall to accomodate. So for now, I think it's a little
too early to let others jump in with big contributions.

If you notice any small bugs please feel free to create an issue on
the Gitlab Issues Page, or create a pull request if you know how to
fix it.
