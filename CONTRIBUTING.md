## Commit Messages

Linus Torvalds describes a good commit message. See [linus-commit].

A good commit message looks like this:

```
Header line: explaining the commit in one line

Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things
in more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue
being fixed, etc etc.
```

Please limit the first line of commit messages to 80 or less characters.
If you want to include more, please separate the **Header** from the
**Body** with a blank line.
